Make a resonable selection of tasks in #file:tmp/TODO.md that are suitable to perform as a single small iteration.
Where feasible, create a failing test before iterating on the code, running `make test` to verify TDD RED and TDD GREEEN during your work. When done, ensure all tests pass with `make test`, then report very briefly with "Done with X tasks: [task list]".
